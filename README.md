# odin-recipes
First Project: Recipes | OP

First project of Odin Project. In this project my foundational HTML and GIT Skills will be tested.

ODIN Project description:
It’s time to practice all of the HTML knowledge you have acquired. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished. Not unless you’re into brutalist web design, that is.

But it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
