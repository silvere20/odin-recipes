    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Caramelized tomato sauce makes this a wonderfully savory dish.<br>        
        The reduction of the tomato broth brings out the sweetness of the tomatoes which balances well with the spiciness of the chili flakes.
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Tomato Broth</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3 cups tomato puree</li>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            <li><b>Cheeses: </b>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
            <li><b>Egg: </b>An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Spaghetti</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Â¼ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons red chili flakes, or to taste</li>
            <li>6 ounces dry spaghetti</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <h3>The steps to make the lasagna:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add garlic and sizzle until it starts to turn golden and fragrant, about 1 minute.<br>
                Stir in tomato puree, water, and salt. Bring to a simmer on medium-high. Once simmering, reduce to low heat and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Pour olive oil into a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat, season with chili flakes and heat until chili flakes start to sizzle, for 1 minute.<br>
                Add raw spaghetti and toss until well coated with chili oil. Pour in about 3 cups of tomato broth and, using tongs, move pasta from side to side to evenly distribute tomato broth.<br>
                Cook, occasionally moving pasta from side to side with tongs, all facing the same direction, until most of the broth has been absorbed or evaporated,<br>
                and the spaghetti starts frying in the pan.</li>
            <li>Turn spaghetti over with tongs, and evenly arrange in the pan. Keep cooking until the pasta starts to brown, and even lightly chars.<br>
                Add about 2 more cups of tomato broth, and repeat the process.<br>
                Continue cooking until the spaghetti is as charred as you like , and cooked to your desired doneness.</li>
            <li>More broth can be added at the end of the process for a saucier version, as shown in the video, or it can be served relatively dry.</li>
            <li>Serve with a drizzle of olive oil and more chili flakes if desired.</li>
        </ol>
