        <h3>The steps to make the lasagna:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>While potatoes are boiling, simmer or steam cabbage in a separate pot until tender. Drain and chop; set aside and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Place leeks in a small pot; add just enough milk to cover. Simmer over low heat until leeks are soft, about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Layer the lasagna according to the recipe instructions.</li>
            <li>Season potatoes with salt, pepper, and mace; mash well. Stir in cooked leeks and milk. Stir in cabbage and heat through until potatoes are pale green in color.<br>
                Make a well in the center of the colcannon and pour in the melted butter. Mix well and serve.</li>
        </ol>
